# Comparing Baltimore & Los Angeles Household and Male Income with Incarceration-Rate
Goal:
The focus of this project is to establish the relationship between average male income and incarceration rate in Los Angeles, CA and Baltimore, MD.  I did this by pulling data from the Opportunity Atlas on household income, male income, and incarceration rate for the two cities. I had the the goal of not only confirming the correlation between low household income and higher incarceration rates, but I also wanted to see if a lower male income had a larger correlation with higher incarceration rates.  Along the way I would also be able to compare incarceration rates, household income, and male income across the two cities.

Results:
My initial thought that Los Angeles would have both higher incomes and lower incarceration rates than Baltimore was confirmed. In fact, the average household in Los Angeles is more than $10,000 higher and the incarceration rate more than 3% lower than those in Baltimore. The chart below shows this information.   

When considering male income and incarceration rates, I was surprised at the results. Male income was similar across the two cities with Los Angeles' result being just $2600 higher. Given that the difference in male income between the two cities is not very sigificant, one may expect similar incarceration rates, yet this was not the case.  Baltimore's overall incarceration rate is 4.6% but that of Los Angeles is 1.6%.  The chart below shows this information
